# INSTRUCTIONS

In order to play "10lines Adventure" you need a COMMODORE 64 or an emulator of this computer, because the game does not work with modern computers. The game has been tried and works correctly with *"VICE - the Versatile Commodore Emulator" ver. 3.2*. You can download it for free by [clicking here](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/).  

Once the emulator software has been installed, follow the instructions below:
 - start **x64.exe** program;
 - click on **File** > **Attach disk image** > **Drive 8**;
 - select <code>adv10-all.d64</code> file ([click here to download](https://github.com/spotlessmind1975/adv10en/blob/master/adv10-all.d64));
 - click on **Attach**;
 - type <code>LOAD "*",8,1</code>;
 - when finished loading, type <code>RUN</code>
