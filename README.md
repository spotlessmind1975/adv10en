This game was created to participate in the ["BASIC10Liner" competition 2020](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/2020), and it won the first place with a **[FRATZENGEBALLER'S SPECIAL AWARD](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/kopie-von-results-2018)**.

Since it joined this competition, the game itself is modest in size (even if it has a couple of puzzles), the given source code respects strong constraints on the length of each line (category: **EXTREME-256**) and it does not rely on third party libraries. For those interested, the Italian edition is also available.

For those wishing to deepen the details of its implementation (**ATTENTION: SPOILERS!**), please refer to the following documents:
