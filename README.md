# adv10en
10lines adventure (english)

This game was created to participate in the ["BASIC10Liner" competition 2020](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/2020). For this reason, the source code respects strong constraints on the length of the lines (**EXTREME-256**) and it does not rely on third party libraries. For those interested, the Italian edition is also available.

For those wishing to deepen the details of its implementation, please refer to the following documents:
